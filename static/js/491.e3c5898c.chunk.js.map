Try to do\n            everything to avoid dehydration of the skin: apply a moisturizer in\n            the morning and evening, you can make a moisturizing mask the day\n            before or put a thick layer of moisturizer on the night before.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The hair should be washed the night before or in the morning with\n            shampoo and conditioner, oil and damp should not be applied. Thermal\n            protection too - I will use it, I will treat your hair as carefully\n            as possible.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Please make sure your hair is 101% dry, it will make my job a lot\n            easier.\n          </p>\n          <h3>How to prepare for a trial?</h3>\n          <p>\n            I will definitely ask you what makeup you wear every day, if you\n            have a photo of your usual makeup, it will be great.\n          </p>\n          <h3>When is the best time for trial of a wedding look?</h3>\n          <p>\n            I recommend holding a trial a month and a half before the wedding.\n            The sooner you do it, the greater the chance that you may change\n            your mind and want a different look. You can find a photo of the\n            makeup or hairstyle you like, ideally several photos.\n          </p>\n          <h3>Does the price include jewellery or extra hair?</h3>\n          <p>\n            No, they are not included. You need to bring your jewellery or hair\n            and I will gladly complete your look with them.\n          </p>\n        </article>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  );\n};\nexport default Faq;\n"],"names":["className","app"],"sourceRoot":""}
